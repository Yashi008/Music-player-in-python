# Music-player-in-python

 A basic implementation of a music player GUI using the Tkinter library for the GUI components and the Pygame library for audio playback.
 It creates a simple music player GUI where users can load and play MP3 songs from a specified directory. The user can control playback using buttons such as play, pause, stop, next, and previous. The names of available songs are displayed in a listbox, and the currently playing song's name is shown in a label.
